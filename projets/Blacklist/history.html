                <small>The beginning</small>
                <p>
                    The roots of Blacklist International first came from SxC Imbalance, who surprised the audience with their amazing performance against crowd favourites Execration in MPL-PH S2. Due to this, Evos Esports decided to acquire the roster and rebrand them as Evos PH. However, in Season 4, corruption plagued the organization which lead to Evos disbanding the team. It isn't the end for the remnants of Evos though, as they were acquired by Tier One Entertainment and rebranded them as Blacklist International. In Season 7, they finally claimed their first championship with the help of the famed VeeWise duo and in M3, managed to destroy all their opponents.

                    They made their first appearance in MPL season 5, they finished 6th place ahead of SGD Omega.
                    During the sixth season of MPL season 6 , Blacklist International would acquire veteran Mark Jayson "ESON" Gerardo ,after a short break from Season 5, and FULLCLIP (now known as Kairi). Blacklist International finished the regular season as the third seed in Group A, with a 3–2 and 8–5 match win–loss result. The team would go on to lose their contention for the championship after getting defeated by smart OMEGA in five games.

                <p>
                    Season 7 is one of the most important season because they got new players from ONIC PH, Johnmar also called "OhMyV33NUS" and Danerie also known as "WISE" these 2 players are also called the "VeeWise Tandem". Blacklist would also pick up Kiel Calvin aka "OHEB" a promosing rookie. Due to her natural leadership and shot calling capability she was appointed as the Captain of the team going in on season 7
                    The new roster dominated the regular season losing once against the defending world champions , BREN ESPORTS.
                    They ended up making it to the finals where they faced OMEGA, blacklist was dominating the last game but their momentum got stopped by Kelra with a lunox savage wiping them out, but they managed to stay calm and focus and won the last teamfight. Blacklist just won their first MPL title.

                    Season 8 Blacklist would remain dominant performance losing once to ONIC PH, Blacklist would finish 13-1 and 26-7games and loses, winning over Bren Esports for their final regular season game. 
                    Blacklist would eventually lose 3-1 against Omega lowering them to the lower bracket. Fun fact : this was partially due to the suspension of their player "OHEB" after pulling a middle finger after their regular season win over smart OMEGA. But in the end blacklist would defeat both EVOS and OMEGA in the lower bracket. They're now in the finals against ONIC PH. Blacklist would be named Champions of MPL Philippines season 8. Blacklist is the second team in MPL PH history to win back to back titles, the others being sunsparks for season 4-5.
